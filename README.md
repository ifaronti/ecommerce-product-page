- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart

### Links

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### Continued development
CSS. After months of practicing different Javascript concepts, I came back to redo this challenege. I'm confident of Javascript and my CSS is getting there. Redoing this project made me realize I need to work on my code readability. The CSS was a mess but I made it better(still a bit of a mess but better mess and better readability)
